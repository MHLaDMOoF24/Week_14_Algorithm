Tasks as far as I got them during the second synchronous session of week 14. 
Up to, and including Task  4.3, Quick Sort implementation. 
The program already includes the method to save the list back down, although it is untested. Still, 4.4 should be easy from here. It likely could've been done in the time it took to write this blurb.
